## Introduction

`plotDataElem` is a post-processing software for [T+H (TOUGH HYDRATE)](https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/) program. It reads `plot_data_elem` file generated by [T+H (TOUGH HYDRATE)](https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/) simulations and converts them `vtu` format. Which can then be visualized by usign PARAVIEW or other vtk readers.

## Installation

`plotDataElem` currently can be installed by using CMake. The project is given below.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/vickysharma0812/plotDataElem.git
 cd ./plotDataElem
 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/Downloads/post_process_th/install -S ./ -B ./build
 cmake --build ./build --target install
```

* `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` specifies the location of where library and binaries will be installed
* The binaray file called `plotDataElem` is installed at `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin`
* You can copy the binary where ever you want

## Getting started

First step is to create following input file (call it `opt.inc`)

```fortran
./        ! path of Plot_Data_Elem file
test      ! prefix for generated vtu files
2         ! Number of variables to be read in vtu file
P         ! Name of variable 1
T         ! Name of variable 2
2         ! Spatial dimension of the grid
true      ! Is grid axis symmetric
```

Subseqently use the following command.

```fortran
plotDataElem < opt.inc
```
